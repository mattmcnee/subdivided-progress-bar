# subdivided-progress-bar

This takes an array of video information in the format shown in "progressBar.js" and creates a progress bar subdivided into a segment for each video
Each segment is proportional in width to the duration of the video it represents
The bar displays the video title of the relevant segment when hovered over and moves down slightly to remain centred vertically
